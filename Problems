In g++-4.1.0, the binfo nodes have a bases: 0 rather than base: @index.
This causes the parser to issue a warning.

Seems to be only this tag.
  Fixed now with a patch to the TranslationUnit.pm (Dec 16th)

gcc 4 seems to only provided the mangled names
of the classes, etc. and not the generic versions.
  Works for 4.1.0, at least.




char is appearing as int.  need the print type to be computed rather
than simply inferred from the name of the class.  The prec (ision)
field is 8 for these and 32 for others.  This could get complicated to
determine entirely accurately when we deal with 64 bit, Unicode,
etc. depending on different compiler configurations, conventions, etc.

  Implemented now in BuiltinType.



Looking at lstat in stat.c.tu on the Mac, we end up with
3 parameters for the routine. This number is the same as
on Linux when using the type node for the function_decl
and not the args node directly. The last of the parameters
is a void.
On Unix, we end up with 2 parameters by using the args
node, and this gives the names of the parameters (e.g. __path).
