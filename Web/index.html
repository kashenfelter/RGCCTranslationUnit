This package provides a mechanism in R to process
C and C++ source code.  This will then allows us to
<ul>
  <li> find  variable and routine declarations,
  <li> find definitions of data structures, classes, and enumeration
  <li> analyze the body of a routine and identify related routines
</ul>

Given this information, we can
<ul>
  <li> automate the creation of bindings to routines and data
  structures</li>
  <li> generate registration information for an R package using native
  routines</li>
  <li> use source code as data for statistical analysis of software itself.</li>
</ul>

The package provides R-level functionality and classes for working
with translation unit dumps from GCC of source code. One uses GCC to
create a .tu file which represents the structure of the source code in
a low-level format. Currently, this information is read into R using a
Perl module <a href="">GCC::TranslationUnit</a>.  This is accessed
from within R via the <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSPerl" >RSPerl
package</a>.  We have developed an almost equivalent C++ based parser
that we are currently in the process of integrating into the package
to remove the dependency on RSPerl.  A new version of the package will
be available at the beginning of July.



<h3>Software</h3>

The current version works but is in the middle of a transition to a
C++ parser and the setup fits my needs rather than being a robust
installation for others.  However, the basics of processing the types,
finding the definitions of routines, classes, methods, data
structures, enumerations, etc.  are working.  I am adding support for
generating bindings and creating registration information as useful
examples of how this material can be used.  I am using this
specifically to generate bindings for R to the <a
href="http://www.wxWidgets.org" >wxWidgets</a> GUI toolkit in the <a
href="http://www.omegahat.org/RwxWidgets" >RwxWidgets</a>.

<h3>Related Projects</h3>
The ability to process source code has been something I and others
have been exploring for some time now.
<dl>

  <li>
   <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSWIG" >RSWIG</a>
     is work I did last summer to add support for
    R to the <a href="">SWIG</a> software for generating bindings
    from C/C++ code to other languages such as Perl, Python, and R.
    <br>
    Joseph Wang has since adapted this and work is ongoing to
    merge the two directions.
    <P/>
    SWIG is useful as it offers a language with which
    "users" can customize the generation of the generated bindings,
    and can use this same input for different target languages.

    There are two obvious limitations with using SWIG
    <ol>
      <li>SWIG is not a compiler and so extracts information about the
    data structures and routines using a more heuristic parser.
     It is extremely good, but is not exactly the same as the
    compiler's view of the code.
      </li>
      <li>SWIG does not give us information about
      the bodies of the routines and so doesn't allow us to analyze
       the code.  This is not important for those only interested
      in generating bindings to R or another language.
      It is an issue for those of us that want a tool for
      analyzing the code itself.</li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <dd>
  
  <dt>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/GccTranslationUnit">GccTranslationUnit</a>
    module is a Python-based tool to read the tu files.</li>
  
  <dd>
</dl>


<h3>Why not SWIG?</h3>

I have thought about how to generate reflection interface from C/C++ code for some time - several
years.  It is not just about generating bindings, although that is
certainly an important target application.
It is also about doing code analysis.

<dl>
  <dt>
  <li>Want others to be able to modify the
       binding generation code directly from within R.
  <dd>

      
  <dt>
  <li>Want to be able to get "correct" results from the compiler, and
    not "pretty close to correct" results from a pseudo compiler/parser.
    
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>
    Want information about the bodies of the routines/methods, and not
    just
    the signature information. This is important for code analysis,
    re-factoring, etc.
    
  <dd>

  <dt>
  <li>
    SWIG's input language allows the user to control what she wants
    to have in the bindings, but it is yet another language to
    understand  and we have one already at our disposal - R.
  <dd>
    
</dl>


I started the work on the SWIG bindings for R because
I feel  that we can use this translation unit approach
to generate input to SWIG and then leverage that
mechanism to generate bindings.
