   <li> I load the package with library(RGCCTranslationUnit) and
       then try to call parseTU() but I get an error message about
       not being able to load GCC::TranslationUnit.
       Any suggestions?
  <dd>
      The RGCCTranslation package makes use of  the
  GCC::TranslationUnit module that is distributed
  as part of this R package. This is installed within
    the installed R package and when the package is
    loaded into R, the PERL5LIB path is updated.
   When you load RSPerl (implicitly by a call to parseTU()),
      this PERL5LIB is used to locate the Perl modules.
      Run
<pre>      
      paste("find", system.file("perl", package =  "RGCCTranslationUnit"), "-name '*.pm')
</pre>      
    from within R and hopefully you will get output that tells you the
      .pm files are in the installed R  directory. If not,
      then reinstall the RGCCTranslationUnit and watch to see if the
      Perl module was installed correctly.

      <p/>
      If the .pm files are present, then the PERL5LIB is set
      incorrectly.
      At present, we are just setting the value to the ususual
      <i>installation directory</i>/share/perl/lib/perl5/site_perl.
      If it should be different for your system, set PERL5LIB before
      you start R (or within R using Sys.setenv() but before loading
      RSPerl)   and send me mail to let me know what it should be for
      your system.

  <dt>
  <li> I want to use this from within R via the RSPerl package.
       However, when I try to refer to GCC::TranslationUnit, I get
       a segmentation fault.  Can I solve this problem?
  <dd>
        Yep! One of the problematic issues of embedding Perl within
      another application, e.g. R,  is that using Perl modules
      that themselves use C code need special handling.
       When installing the RSPerl package, use
<pre>      
 R CMD INSTALL --clean --configure-args='--with-in-perl
      --with-modules="IO Fcntl Socket POSIX"' RSPerl
</pre>
       This builds support for the modules IO, Fcntl and Socket for use within
      this embedded setup. Without these, we unfortunately get crashes
      within R. The RSPerl package currently cannot detect the
      problem.
      If you are using compressed files (as the .tu files are rather
      large),
      you should also both install the Perl modules
      Compress::Raw::Zlib and File::Glob
      and include them in the list of modules (in that form of naming)
      in the installation of
      RSPerl. Yes - this is annoying!

  <dt>
  <li> I tried the installation as suggested with the PERL_MODULES
      above, but I still get segmentation faults when I try to call
      parseTU().  Any other suggestions? @#$!!!
  <dd>
      Yep, but this one is even less pleasant. My guess is that you
      have a multi-threaded version of Perl, i.e. when you give the R
      command
<pre>
      library(RSPerl)
      .PerlGetArray("INC")
</pre>
      some of the elements have
      "thread-multi" in the directory name.
      <br>
      If this is the case, for the moment, you will have to install
      a version of perl in a separate place on your machine that has
      no
      thread support.
      
  <dt>
  <li> What's the overhead or penalty for using compressed tu files,
      i.e. tu.gz files?
  <dd>
      Well, on one of my machines - a hyper-threaded 3.2 GHz Pentium 4
      with 1 GB of physical RAM and 3 GB of swap - the timings I got
       for the wxWidgets file wx/grid.cpp.tu  was a factor of 4.
<table>
<tr>
<td>uncompressed file</td>  <td>21.840</td><td>0.230</td><td>22.167</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>compressed .gz file</td> <td> 81.960</td><td>  0.210</td><td> 82.315</td>
</tr>  


<dt>
<li> I generate the TU file from a C++ code that contains the
    definitions  of several classes.  But when I read the contents of
    the TU  file into R and call <code>getClassNodes()</code>,
    not all the classes appear. What's the problem?
    
<dd>  Most likely, g++ is eliminating the classes that are not used in
    your code.  If no C++ code actually creates or operates on an
    instance of this class (or refers to static methods),
    then the compiler assumes that class is not needed.
    So you can add some simple code that manipulates
    such an object, e.g. for a class named A
<pre>
void _dummy() {
  A a;  // or use an appropriate constructor.
}
</pre>


<dt>
<li> I want to use -D_GNU_SOURCE and get some additional information
    and I am using the regular gcc compiler. However, I still don't
    get  this extra information.
<dd>
    Some code in system header files, etc. have a clause such as
<pre>
#if defined __USE_GNU && !defined __cplusplus
typedef enum __rlimit_resource __rlimit_resource_t;
typedef enum __rusage_who __rusage_who_t;
typedef enum __priority_which __priority_which_t;
#else
typedef int __rlimit_resource_t;
typedef int __rusage_who_t;
typedef int __priority_which_t;
#endif    
</pre>    
(see sys/resource.h).
To get this extra information from using __USE_GNU which is
 defined when _GNU_SOURCE is passed on the command line
 (or in a file), we must also ensure that
 the macro symbol __cplusplus is not defined.
    It would be if we are using g++.
    But it turns out that, at least with certain versions of gcc
    if not all of them,  having a .cc extension on a file will
    cause this macro symbol to be defined.  So you must
    use a simple .c extension for the file before passing
    it to gcc to dump the translation unit.
    Annoying!
