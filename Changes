0.7-0

   *  Changed the signature of convertCharArrayToR() and convertDoubleArrayToR().
      Old versions are there with _full appended to name.

0.6-0

   *   Fix for real_cst converting the value to an integer.

   *   Fox for string_cst including a space at the end of the string.

   *   Changed the field name for string_cst from strg to string to be consistent
       with identifier_node

   *   getValue() doesn't quote the value for string_cst.


0.5-1

   *   namespace_decl nodes were being returned as objects of R class "GCCNode" rather than
       "GCC::Node::namespace_decl" (due to a missing const in the definition of the
        RTypeName() method).

0.5-0

   *   Documentation updates, class definitions and general cleanup 


                                                                    April, '08
   *   TranslationUnit.pm reports operator names correctly (note: operator name)

   *   Added TUOptions() to control top-level options for the code generation.

   *   Using objects to represent R functions (and C routines, methods)

   *   constructorNamePrefix TU option for changing the name of all constructors, e.g.
       to newC from just C so we can avoid conflicts with existing functions with a different
       signature.

Version 0.4-0                                                       December, 06

   *  TranslationUnit.pm can handle output from gcc/g++ 4.1.0
	* map accs to access
	* map values of accs (priv, prot, pub) to private, protected, public
	  to be consistent with the pre-4.1.0 output
	* map note: value to value: 1 in the node.
	* explicitly handle bases: <int> which was causing failure.
	
	* ngetClassNodes uses a different approach to find the class nodes. (Slower)
   	* put "version" field in first (0-th) node.

   *  function (getRegistrationInfo) to collect and compute the registration code 
      for C/C++ routines referenced in R code.

   *  getFields() returns the nodes and not the INDEX of each node.
