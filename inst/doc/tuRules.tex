\section{Typedef}

The record_type has an unql if there is a typedef for the 
node.

\section{Default Values for Arguments}

Default values for arguments.
These are stored.

In the function_decl, we have a reference to 
the type which contains the parameters.
These parameters can lok like
 valu, chan
or have an additional purp field.

The valu field identifies the type.
The purp field gives the default value.
The purp field has the appropriate type
for the value, e.g integer_cst, string_cst.
(Note "" is represented as
   string_cst       type: @456    strg:          lngt: 1      
)
